# Q7.5 What makes Extra-Trees more random than regular Random Forests? How can this extra randomness help? Are Extra-Trees slower or faster than regular Random Forests?

- The threshold is always random.  
- Trades more bias for less variance.
- Training is faster.

Book says: However, they are neither faster nor slower than Random Forests when making predictions
