## Book Questions

### 1. What is the approximate depth of a Decision Tree trained (without restrictions) on a training set with one million instances?

[Answer](q_6_1_ans.md)

***

### 2. Is a node’s Gini impurity generally lower or greater than its parent’s? Is it generally lower/greater, or always lower/greater?

[Answer](q_6_2_ans.md)

***

### 3. If a Decision Tree is overfitting the training set, is it a good idea to try decreasing max_depth? p247

[Answer](q_6_3_ans.md)

***

### 4. If a Decision Tree is underfitting the training set, is it a good idea to try scaling the input features?

[Answer](q_6_4_ans.md)

### 5. If it takes one hour to train a Decision Tree on a training set containing 1 million instances, roughly how much time will it take to train another Decision Tree on a training set containing 10 million instances?

[Answer](q_6_6_ans.md)

***

### 6. If your training set contains 100,000 instances, will setting speed up training?
