# Q4.9 Suppose you are using Ridge Regression and you notice that the training error and the validation error are almost equal and fairly high. Would you say that the model suffers from high bias or high variance? Should you increase the regularization hyperparameter Î± or reduce it?

a) High-bias - underfitting
b) reduce alpha.  Makes it more flexible
