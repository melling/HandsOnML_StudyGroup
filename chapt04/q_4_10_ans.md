# Q4.10 Why would you want to use:

- a. Ridge Regression instead of plain Linear Regression (i.e., without any regularization)?
- b. Lasso instead of Ridge Regression?
- c. Elastic Net instead of Lasso?

a) Ridge Always want a little bit of regularization L2. p200
b) Lasso. if you think few parameters are important. Reduces them to zero L1 Norm. p200
c) "Elastic Net is preferred over Lasso because Lasso may behave erratically when the number of features is greater than the number of training instances or when several features are strongly correlated" p200
