# Hands On Machine Learning StudyGroup

***

The main group is based in New York City and currently meets virtually every 2 weeks: https://www.meetup.com/Kaggle-NYC

The study group works together and independently to support each other in the effort to master the material in the book.  

Self-paced and self-study is encouraged.  We meet regularly to discuss the material in the chapters.
